 Random Project

This program will:
 
•	Open and parse the file, ignoring non-line item rows AND ignore sub items rows.
•	Determine the dollar amount of profit for each line item based on the production cost vs the sell price
•	Sort them by the most profitable 
•	Print out the top 10 most profitable with each line of output showing the following data
o	ID, Production Cost, Production Price , Profit ($), Profit (%), Name
•	Make the output align each column so its easy to view.
•	Extra credit: allow your program to specify the number of line items to show (defaulting to 10) – “./myprogram.py -n 15”
•	Extra credit: allow your program to specify the least profitable (defaulting to most) -  “./myprogram.py -least”
 
You will have to touch many different concepts here that would be useful to learn.
 
Stick it all in a repo on github and try to make useful commit messages as you work.
